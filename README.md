# Spotitry
A python script that uses Spotipy to create a custom Spotify playlist based on a user's current "short term" listening habits.

This is currently a work in progress. The current results can be seen <a href=https://aidan-draper.myportfolio.com/spotify-playlist-creator>here</a>.

To create your own playlist, download the winterproj.py file and create a .txt file with your text editor of choice. Within that .txt file, add your username, client id, client secret, and redirect uri on their own lines and in that order.
